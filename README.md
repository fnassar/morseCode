## Background and Inspiration:
The Louvre Museum in Abu Dhabi hosted a University take over the musium challenge. The prompt for the challenge was "Sustainability, tangibility", the art work, whatever it is, has to show these concepts or reflect these concepts. We also had to choose an artifact from the musium as an inspiration. We wanted to work with love and morseode. On the museum website we found a poem by Al-Mutanabi, called " Love is What Prevents Toungues from Speaking". The title of the poem reflected a lot of what we wanted to work with, especially with morse code being a language that's not made for toungs to speak. It is a language, like love, which is communicated at times the sound we make, or do not make, doesn't have the ability of reaching the other side. It is a language that can be used to share secret messages using taps or beeps that not many would understand. We worked with morse code to convert a feeling of love, a memory or a story, into what can be a tangible, secret message shared for very few to understand.

## Code:

### P5
The animation on p5js was our first step. Part of our prototype. We did it so we can visualise what our project was and how to work with it, an animation of a spiral morsecode that uses an input text, translates the letters to equivalent latin morse code characters. We just added the name of the user input later on to help the user identify their morse code outputs.
